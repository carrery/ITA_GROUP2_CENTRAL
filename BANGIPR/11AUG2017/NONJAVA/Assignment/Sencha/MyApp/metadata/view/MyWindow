Your pearlescent skin akin to mine glowed faintly, your dark brown eyes like your father’s were huge and calculating; your raven hair was floating, like you were constantly submerged on the fours seas. It was the only indication of how powerful you are, my daughter, for only the union of the most hazardous queen and the most violent and mighty king could produce such a dangerous weapon. Yet there was nothing to me more precious in the world than my little one. How I adored you. Your father was elated, for he now has a heir to the throne of his kingdom. Your mere presence in court was commanding and explosive, with violent outburst of power and rage, scaring the humans that served your father for years. But you were young; I understood that great power is hard to control. But others did not, for you pose a threat to their plan.  </i></p>",

The Abysmal Sea, out of all the four seas that surround and nurture the kingdom, is the most thunderous, the emptiest of souls, and the most fearsome. Surrounded by miles and miles of inhabitable land, this sea gave no life, but only death in the most agonizing way. Thunderstorms and typhoons visit with frequency, destroying all traces of civilization that has tried to stay in this land.

There are so many bones, piling up after eons of wars, which the brutal sunshine has dissolved them all into a vast expanse of shining white sand dunes and is slowly eaten away by the turbulent waters.</p></i>",
